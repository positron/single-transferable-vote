## Background
Voting systems is a fascinating area of study that not many people think about.
It turns out there are a lot of possible voting systems besides the [first-past-the-post][post] voting system commonly used in Western Democracies.
Even more interesting, a voting system that is ideally fair in every scenario is [provably impossible][arrows].

If you want to learn more about STV, the [wikipedia page][stv] is helpful.
C.G.P Grey also has an excellent youtube series on [voting][cgpgrey] that ends with a [great explanation of STV][stvvideo].
